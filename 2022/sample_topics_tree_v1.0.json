But there are a lot more things to do in California, many more places to visit than just Hollywood. From beautiful cities to gorgeous countryside, from water sports to historical sites to raw nature at its finest, there is something for everyone in the state Americans affectionately refer to as the 'Left Coast'. San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco are all great places to start exploring California. Once you are done with them, work your way along the coast as you head into the mountainous northern regions. While there, take a trip along the scenic Pacific Coast Highway. It is a breath-taking drive you are bound to remember for the rest of your life.",
