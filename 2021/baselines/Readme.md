## Baseline run description

The baseline system is a three-retrieval process where, given a query, (1) the top-n documents are retrieved from the index and (2) chunked into passages using Spacy's SentenceRecognizer pipeline. (3) Passages are then re-ranked using a neural re-ranker.

For (1), we use a simple BM25 function (K1=4.46, b=0.82), and for (3), we use a [T5 re-ranker](https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.63/) trained on the MS MARCO passage dataset.

`y3_manual_results_500.v1.0.run` is the results file generated by retrieving and re-ranking the passages from the top 500 documents. 

`y3_manual_results_1000.v1.0.run` is the results file generated by retrieving and re-ranking the passages from the top 1000 documents.
